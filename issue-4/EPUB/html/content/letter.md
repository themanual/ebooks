_It’s good to be back._

We return from our hiatus a very different publication. Most significantly, there is now a good chance you’re not reading these words on a printed page. To those of you joining us from your browser, tablet, e-reader, phone, speakers, or headphones, welcome. We’re very glad to have you.

Although _The Manual_ will always be a physical book, the decision to publish exclusively in print was one that prioritized romance over readers. It’s easy, given that our work on the web can often feel ephemeral and delicate, to glamorize the idea of producing something “real.” While enshrining these ideas within the pages of a physical book felt befitting, it was a decision that cut us off in many ways from the wider conversation.

By choosing to publish our articles and lessons as ebooks, audiobooks, and making all of our issues freely available on the web, we’re finally joining the conversation in a broader, more accessible way. We’re meeting you where you want to read, giving you the opportunity to reflect, and most importantly, respond.

Amidst all these changes, our mission remains the same. _The Manual_ will continue to be a home to the best thinking around designing for the web. We will continue to discuss our work as a design discipline rather than merely as a technical skill. We will continue to contribute to and encourage a richer, deeper discourse, a conversation we believe will lead us all to do better work.

We now return to our regularly scheduled programming.
